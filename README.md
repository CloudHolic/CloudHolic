HATE competitive programming

What I can do:
  - C# & WPF
  - pure C & low-level programming (a bit)


What I have interested in (except above things):
  - C++ & Qt
  - C#-based 2d game library (e.g., Monogame or Duality)
  - Blazor & ASP.NET
  - Angular & Typescript

Well... someday I can do it...
